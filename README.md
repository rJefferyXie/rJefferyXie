# Hi there! 👋

# About Me 
🎓 I am Jeffery Xie, a Full-Stack Web Developer with a Computer Science degree from the University of Saskatchewan.
<br />

🖥 I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself everyday, especially when it comes to front-end web development. Outside of University, I learned how to use technologies such as Next.JS (React.JS), Google Firebase, Redux, TypeScript, and Cypress.
<br />

🏸 Outside of coding, my current favourite hobbies include going to the gym, watching professional wrestling (AEW, WWE), and playing sports like badminton and basketball.
